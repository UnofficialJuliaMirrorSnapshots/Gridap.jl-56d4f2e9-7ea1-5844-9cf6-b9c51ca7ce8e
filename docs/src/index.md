# Gridap.jl

Documentation of the Gridap library.

## Introduction

Gridap provides a set of tools for the grid-based approximation of
partial differential equations (PDEs) written in the
[Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
The goal is to provide a user friendly interface to a
rich set of discretization techniques such as
conforming and discontinuous Galerkin methods,
embedded domain techniques, and adaptive mesh refinement.

## How to use this documentation

* The first step for new users is to visit the [Getting Started](@ref) page.
