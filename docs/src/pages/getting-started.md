# Getting Started

## Installation requirements

At the moment, Gridap requires at least Julia version 1.1.

Gridap has been tested on Linux and Mac Os operating systems.

## Installation

Gridap is a registered package. Thus, the installation should be straight forward using the Julia's package manager [Pkg](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/): open the Julia REPL (i.e., execute the `julia` binary), type `]` to enter package mode, and install Gridap as follows

```julia
pkg> add Gridap
```

That's all.

For further information about how to install and manage Julia packages, see the
[Pkg documentation](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/).

## Further steps

We recommend to follow the [Gridap Tutorials](https://github.com/gridap/Tutorials) in order to get familiar with the library.
