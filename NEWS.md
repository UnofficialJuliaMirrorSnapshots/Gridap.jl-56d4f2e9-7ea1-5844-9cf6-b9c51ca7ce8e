## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `NEWS.md` file (a changelog file)
- `CompressedCellValue`, `CompressedCellArray`, and `CompressedCellMap`, as well as efficient versions of `apply`, `evaluate`, and `reindex` for these types. See PR [#41](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/41) for more details.
- `NonIterableCellMap`, a cell map that has iteration intentionally disabled. Available since commit [956a537](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/commit/956a5374db6c3b9546e85e0d4d49ae0560057565).
- `BoundaryTriangulation` an integration mesh used to integrate `CellField` and `CellBasis` objects restricted on a surface. Available since commit [e981f3c](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/commit/e981f3c221f3624cfc6764efa47f22652fc22b4f)
- Function `restrict` for restricting `CellField` and `CellBasis` objects to surfaces. Available since commit [e981f3c](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/commit/e981f3c221f3624cfc6764efa47f22652fc22b4f)
- `IdentityCellNumber`, an indexable cell number that simply returns the given index. Also efficient implementation of `reindex` for this type (i.e. do nothing). Available since commit [b6b4c32](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/commit/b6b4c32c8c4b826a41ba64c770ac8a1c394e16f0)
- Support of FE assembly for weak forms with terms that are integrated over different domains. See issue [#42](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/issues/42) and PR [#43](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/43).

### Changed
- Changed the signature of `assemble`, `apply_constraints`, `apply_constraints_rows`, and `apply_constraints_cols` to support FE assembly of several terms, which  are integrated in different domains. The old API of `asseble` is still functional, but not for the `apply_constraints` et al. Since PR [#43](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/pull/43).


### Removed
### Deprecated
### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2019-06-29

A changelog is not maintained for this version.

This version introduces the core finite element machinery for linear and non-linear problems,
single field and multi-field problems with terms integrated over the interior of the computational domain.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-05-20

A changelog is not maintained for this version.

This version is non functional. It is just a tag for registering the package.
